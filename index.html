  <h1>AI Awareness Middleware</h1>
  <h2>The Next Evolution of AI</h2>

  <p>
    Most AI tools today are smart &mdash; but they're blind. They can't see your computer, your files, or what's changing unless you explicitly tell them.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project is a proof of concept that gives AI something it's never really had before: <strong>awareness</strong>. I built a system where AI can:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>See my files and folders</li>
    <li>Read logs and notes</li>
    <li>Monitor my system for changes</li>
    <li>Remember context over time</li>
    <li>Respond to me in plain English</li>
    <li>Even notify me <em>before</em> I notice something has changed</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    It runs on a <strong>hybrid engine</strong>: a lightweight local model for speed and privacy, combined with a powerful cloud AI for higher-level interpretation. That means it works fast, offline when needed, and cost-effectively.
  </p>

  <p>
    This isn’t just a better chatbot. It’s the start of a true digital assistant &mdash; one that can <strong>see, think, and act</strong> inside your real environment.
  </p>

    <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is a personal proof of concept built by one person in spare time. It uses a combination of open-source tools and self-developed middleware. It’s not a polished product, and I’m not offering support.
